# Profile Page Project

## Task 1

Time to have fun building a User Profile Page.  You’ll do this step by step. The HTML code is ready for you. Your task is to use CSS to bring the page to life.

User profile pages have a great impact on a website’s success. Let’s start by applying some color and alignments

1. Set the background color of the body to DarkSlateGrey
2. Center-align the headings and paragraphs, and set their text color to white
3. “Run” the code to preview the page. Then “save” your progress and move on

## Task 2

Let’s continue enhancing your User Profile Page. In this step, you’ll create styling rules to enrich the content.

Next, you’ll set fonts for the page and align the profile section. You’ll also make the streak section easier to understand for the user.

1. Set the font-family of the body to Arial, sans-serif
2. Center-align the #profile section and color its text with #FFFFFF
3. Color .active-day elements with #00CC00 and .inactive-day with #CCCCCC to represent active and inactive days, respectively

## Task 3

You are making excellent progress! The next step is to style the lists to make them blend seamlessly with our design.

In this step, you’ll style the lists in the #profile and #streak sections to enhance the visual coherence of the page.

1. Override the default list style from the lists in both profile and streak sections by setting list-style to none
2. Give the list in the #streak section a contrasting white background and add rounded corners with a border-radius of 5px
3. Change the color of the paragraphs in the streak section to #676767 so the text can be read on the new background
4. Save your progress to move forward

## Task 4

You’re stepping into exciting territory now. You’ll make use of the Box model to enhance the aesthetic and readability of your page.

In this step you’ll fine-tune margins and paddings.

1. Apply display: inline to the list items in the profile section and add a 15px margin around them
2. Add a 10px padding-top to the whole streak section (container)
3. Apply display: inline to the list in the streak section and give it 5px margin and 5px padding
4. Apply display: inline to the paragraphs in the streak section and add a 10px margin

## Task 5

You’re at the final step! Bring the page to life with animations.

In this step, you’ll apply a pulsing animation to the active days to make them change in size and color.

1. Apply animation-name: pulse to the .active-day elements
2. Make the duration of the animation 2s and ensure it plays infinite times
3. Use @keyframes for the pulse animation to make the text size change from 100% and 120% and back again, and change the color to #00CC00 at the 50% mark of the animation

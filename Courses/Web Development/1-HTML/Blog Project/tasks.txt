# Blog Project

## Task 1: About Me
### Formatting Text
Let's get back to our blog project.
The About Me section will contain a heading that's wrapped
in a <h1> tag, along with two paragraphs that format text
using the tags you've just learned.

You may have noticed that we've also used some CSS to add
colors and styles to the page. When you complete HTML, we
strongly recommend our free CSS Tutorial!

Task:
1. Create your own About Me section by changing the text.
2. Experiment with formatting text.

### Summary
You are doing great! The next step is the "Summary" section.
The "Summary" section is a brief section of your resume that
highlights your professional accomplishments and describes
your greatest strengths, skills, and personal qualities.

Task:
1. Write "Summary" below the horizontal line enclosed in
   <h2> element.
2. Immediately below, write your summary inside the
   <p> element.

Hint:
Use <i> tag to make the "Summary" italic.

## Task 2: My Skills
### My Skills
Back to our blog! Let's create the My Skills section, which
is an unordered list of languages you know.

Reminder:
Use the <ul> tag, in which each item is represented by the
<li> tag, to create an unordered list.

We'll learn how to add progress bars to each of the skills
in the following module.

Task:
1. Create your own My Skills section.
2. Use the <a> tag to make each list item a link.

## Task 3: My Schedule
### My Schedule
Use table tags to add a table to your blog that represents
your daily learning schedule. The <th> tags represent the
table headers.

The empty <td> tags represent empty table cells. They're
necessary because they maintain the table's structure.

Task:
Customize the table to create your unique schedule!

## Task 4: Contact Form
### Contact Form
Next, we'll create a Contact Form for your blog.
The form will include Name, Email, and Message fields.
We'll also add a Submit button.

This is just a static HTML page, so it won't work to actually
submit the form. You'd need to create the server-side code in
order to submit a real form and process the data. To learn
how, complete SoloLearn's PHP course once you've completed
the HTML and CSS courses.

Task:
Check out the code and customize the form to fit your needs!

### Message
And now, for the finishing touch!
To complete the form, let's add a field for the message and
a submission button!

Task:
1. Inside the form, define the <textarea> element, and
   add the placeholder attribute with "Message" value.
2. Make all the fields required by adding an eponymous
   attribute at the end.
3. For the submit button, add the <input> element with
   type = "submit" and value = "SEND" attributes.

Hint:
You can also add the type attribute to the fields with
corresponding values.

## Task 5: Putting It All Together
### Blog Project
To finalize our blog, we'll use a frame to embed a YouTube
video. We'll also create a Follow Me section that includes
links at the end of the page.

Task:
1. Finalize your blog page.
2. Share your code creation with the community, get feedback,
   and receive upvotes!

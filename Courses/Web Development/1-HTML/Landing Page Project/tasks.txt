# Landing Page Project

## Task 1

It's time to build your very own HTML project. You'll be doing this step by step, from scratch. By the end of this course, you'll have created a product landing page.

In step 1, let's kick off by adding the heading and the image.

1. Modify the given h1 element with the name of your product.
2. Add the image element below the heading. Use the URL provided in the playground.
3. "Run" the code to preview the page. Then save your progress and move on.

## Task 2

In digital marketing, a landing page is where a visitor “lands” after clicking on a link in an email, an ad on Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

Landing pages are designed and written to be clear, concise, and highly persuasive, so people take action.

1. Add a <p> element with a product description below the image
2. Add a comment to explain your code
3. Remember to commit your changes when you’re happy with the result, to save and move on

## Task 3

Ready to continue with your HTML project? Let’s keep building your product landing page.

Let’s make it easier for your customers to buy your product, by adding a  special section with an order form.

1. Start adding a descriptive h2 heading to draw attention to the ordering section
2. Add a well-structured <form> element with both text and email input type
3. Add a "Submit" button to the form

## Task 4

You’re doing an amazing job! Let’s use everything you’ve learned to take your landing page to the next level.

1. Create the page <header> and put the h1 heading inside
2. Create the <main> section and put the rest of the content inside
3. Create the <footer> at the bottom of the page and add some content
